# Module 13: Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity

In this module, we created an interactive dashboard using Plotly, JavaScript, and HTML. We used Plotly to create various charts in the JS file to be displayed on the dashboard, with the information updating each time a new selection was made in a drowdown menu.

## Acknowledgment
I received a lot of help on this challenge from tutor Geronimo Perez. I would not have been able to complete it without his patience and supurb guidance through the code.
